### Quant and data analyst based in Porto Alegre (RS), Brazil

I'm a data analyst who found his true passion in finance. These are some skills I'm mastering: backtesting of strategies based on technical indicators, portfolio optimization, stocks screening based on fundamental indicators, and so on. 

In 2020, I completed a two-year specialization in Big Data, Data Science and Data Analytics at Unisinos, Brazil.

I have a Bachelor's degree in Journalism (2005) and a PhD in Comparative Literature (2015), both at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Brazil.
